ðŸ“š Digital Library Organizer
A comprehensive PHP-based system demonstrating fundamental data structures and algorithms through a practical library management application.
ðŸŽ¯ Project Purpose
This project demonstrates three fundamental data structures used in computer science:

Recursion - Hierarchical data traversal
Hash Tables - Constant-time data retrieval (O(1))
Binary Search Trees - Efficient sorted data storage and searching (O(log n))

The system simulates a digital library where books are organized into categories, stored with metadata, and searchable through efficient algorithms.

ðŸš€ Features
Part I: Recursive Directory Display

Purpose: Navigate nested library categories using recursive functions
Complexity: O(n) - visits each item once
Key Concepts:

Recursive function calls
Base and recursive cases
Hierarchical data structures
Visual indentation to show depth



Part II: Hash Table for Book Details

Purpose: Store and retrieve book metadata instantly
Complexity: O(1) - constant-time lookups
Key Concepts:

Key-value pair storage
Hash function implementation
Fast data retrieval
Collision handling



Part III: Binary Search Tree

Purpose: Organize books alphabetically with efficient searching
Complexity: O(log n) - logarithmic search time
Key Concepts:

Node-based tree structure
Binary search property (left < parent < right)
Inorder traversal for sorted output
Recursive insertion and searching



Part IV: Integrated System

Purpose: Combine all three data structures into one cohesive application
Features:

Click books in the recursive tree to view details
Search books using hash table lookup
Verify existence in BST
Alphabetically sorted book list
